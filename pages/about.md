The disqus comment section is disabled as this isn't intended to be a blog per se. If you have questions about the work here, or there is something wrong, you can politely let me know. Science is the process of being [wrong](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/the-key-to-science-and-life-is-being-wrong/), hopefully in the right direction.
